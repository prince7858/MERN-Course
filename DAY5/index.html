        <h1>Switch Statement</h1>    
        <p>The switch statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions. 
            It compares a value to a set of possible values and executes the code block associated with the first matching value. 
            The switch statement is often used in combination with the break statement to exit the switch block once a match is found.</p>
       
<h2> Ternary Operator </h2>

<p>The ternary operator is a shorthand way to write an if-else statement. 
    It takes three operands: a condition, a true expression, and a false expression. 
    The condition is evaluated first, and if it is true, the true expression is evaluated and returned, 
    otherwise the false expression is evaluated and returned.</p>
